# Aegis client remapping project powered by the Venezuelan immigrant Aegis dick rider named s0ropt

A auth emulator will (hopefully) released alongside this.

## Why?

Just look at the quality of this client...

### Obfuscating their KillAura and Velocity using a native obfuscator (which probably slows down their performance by 8x)

Native obfuscations should be used only in sensitive parts like auth — but no, we obfuscate our killaura and velocity with it.
There's no "bypasses" in a KillAura, it's simply just getting the right settings (CPS, Range, movement correction, etc.).
KillAura implementations are generic by design:
if you **don't make it generic** and have many options, you probably won't be able to bypass as many ACs as you could!

### Lying about their price

![lmao](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0903a138-739f-4eae-9b3b-e07059b37cb6)

it's $16 lifetime and $4 monthly, and 4² is 16...

ALL you HAD to DO is make sure that you're rotating <= 37° on the yaw axis... If you're using edge angle then you can do 40° instead.
You can't really do too much about the diag telly checks other than try to make it look less like you're diag tellying

### HAS A ["GET LAG" module](https://github.com/MarkGG8181/aegis-remap/blob/2a9fd2229e020be1cb8df3303f35de610c060e81/src/main/java/nikoisntcat/client/modules/impl/GetLagModule.java#L13)

do we really need that?
